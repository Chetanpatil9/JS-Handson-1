        A
        <
        10
         and 
        A
        >
        B
        ) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.</b><br>

        <pre><b>Ans.</b>
            const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
                return (a<10 && a>b);
             };

    <b>Ques 3. Check the conditons
        You are given two numbers 
        A
         and 
        B
        . You need to do the following checks:
        
       1. if both are divisible by 10 console true.
       2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
       3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
        Use operator to do this.</b><br>
      
    <pre><b>Ans.</b>
